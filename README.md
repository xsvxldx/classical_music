### Exploratory analysis on classical music pieces  

This was a project to excercise my skills on data analysis and the main python libraries used for this purpose.
Being a frustrated musician, it was a fun thing to do, but as I moved forward, I realised that I wasn't considering some important features to do a proper musical analysis, such as intention, emotion, intensity, and others. Instead, I was doing a mathematical analysis that didn't feel right to judge these musical pieces by.  

Nonetheless, as I stated before, it was fun to apply concepts on data analysis and programming in a personal project, and doing research of every obstacle I came across with. I see this as a kickstarter for more interesting projects and a valuable experience.  

The data used was found in kaggle, right [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imsparsh/musicnet-dataset).
